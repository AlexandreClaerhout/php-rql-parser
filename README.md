A PHP RQL Parsing Library

## How to use

Basically, this library consists of the following parts:

* A simple PHP RQL Parsing library, parsing a RQL expression into an array form (trying to match https://github.com/persvr/rql/
as closely as possible)
* An interface that you can implement in your class. The inherited class will receive calls on the interface function in order to really implement the query in your business logic.
* An example implementation of that interface.

## Example usage

```php

```
